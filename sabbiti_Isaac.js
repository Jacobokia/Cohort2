/*this is done using the for loop*/
for(var a = 50; a<=100; a++){/*this is the condition of the loop, it looks for a variable from 50 too 100 and uses the increment operator to move systematically one by one up to 100 from 50*/
if (a%2!==0){console.log(a)}/*this is the modulus oprator that checks for the evenness of a number by using the modulus. so if the number, when divided by 2 has a remainder of 1, then it is odd*/
